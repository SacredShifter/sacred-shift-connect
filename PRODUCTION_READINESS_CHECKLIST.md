## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp env.example .env.local
   # Fill in production values
   ```

2. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Run all migrations
   supabase db push
   # Verify RLS policies
   supabase db diff
   ```

3. **Build and Deploy**
   ```bash
   # Build for production
   npm run build
   # Deploy to your hosting platform
   ```

4. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Test all authentication flows
