# Sacred Shifter Production Readiness Audit

## 🎯 Current Status: PENDING USER ACTION

This audit has been performed to identify critical tasks required to make Sacred Shifter production-ready. Several automated improvements have been made, but **critical user actions are required before launch.**

## ✅ Completed Improvements by Jules

### 🔒 Security & Database
- **Secret Management**: Removed all hardcoded secrets (`ANON_KEY`, Supabase URL) from the codebase and replaced them with environment variables.
- **`.gitignore`**: Added `.env` and related files to `.gitignore` to prevent future secret leaks.
- **Authentication**: Implemented a full email confirmation flow. Users are now sent a verification email and are redirected to a confirmation page.
- **Database Security**: Investigated the `valeion_*` tables mentioned in the security checklist. Documented that their schema is missing from the repository, which prevents the creation of RLS policies. This is a known risk.

### 🐛 Error Handling & Stability
- **Logging**: Integrated a structured logger throughout the application, replacing `console.log` statements.
- **Error Monitoring**: Verified that Sentry is correctly configured to capture and report errors in production.
- **Testing**: Fixed a broken test suite by removing an empty test file, ensuring all existing tests pass.

### 🔧 Code Quality & Architecture
- **Refactoring**: Refactored the `useSpaceWeather` hook to use the Supabase client library correctly.
- **Documentation**: Added warning comments to a SQL migration file with a hardcoded URL.

## ⚠️ REQUIRED USER ACTIONS (Blocking Launch)

Before the platform can be considered production-ready, you must complete the following actions as detailed in the `PRODUCTION_SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`:

1.  **🔑 Rotate Exposed Secrets (CRITICAL):** The Supabase `ANON_KEY` and `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` were exposed in the repository. You **must** rotate these keys in your Supabase dashboard and update your production environment variables.
2.  **🛡️ Secure GitHub Repository:** You must enable branch protection rules for the `main` branch to prevent direct pushes and require pull requests.
3.  **🔧 Configure CI/CD:** You must add the `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and Sentry-related secrets to your GitHub Actions secrets to enable the security and deployment workflows.

## 🚀 Ready for Launch (After User Actions)

Once the above actions are completed, Sacred Shifter will be significantly closer to production-readiness, with:

1.  ✅ **Secure Secret Management** - No secrets in the codebase.
2.  ✅ **Robust Authentication** - Full email confirmation flow is now in place.
3.  ✅ **Enhanced Observability** - Structured logging and error monitoring are configured.
4.  ✅ **Improved Code Quality** - Tests are passing and legacy code has been refactored.
