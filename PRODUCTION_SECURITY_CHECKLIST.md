## ⚠️ REQUIRED USER ACTIONS

### 🔑 1. SECRET ROTATION (CRITICAL - DO IMMEDIATELY)

You must rotate these keys since they were in the repository:

**Supabase Keys:**
```bash
# Current keys that need rotation:
ANON_KEY: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
PROJECT_ID: mikltjgbvxrxndtszorb
```

**Action Required:**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mikltjgbvxrxndtszorb/settings/api)
2. Click "Generate new anon key" 
3. Update all production deployments with new key
4. Revoke old keys after confirming new ones work

### 🛡️ 2. GITHUB REPOSITORY SECURITY

**Branch Protection (CRITICAL):**
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Branches
2. Add protection rule for `main` branch:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Restrict pushes that create files
   - ✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings

**Repository Settings:**
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → General
2. ✅ Disable "Allow force pushes" 
3. ✅ Disable "Allow deletions"
4. ✅ Enable "Always suggest updating pull request branches"

**CODEOWNERS Setup:**
1. Update `CODEOWNERS` file with your actual GitHub username
2. Replace `@sacred-shifter-admin` with `@yourusername`

### 🔧 3. CI/CD CONFIGURATION

**GitHub Secrets Required:**
Add these to GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

```
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_supabase_access_token>
SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=mikltjgbvxrxndtszorb
```

**Get Supabase Access Token:**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard → Account → Access Tokens](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens)
2. Create new token with project access
3. Add to GitHub secrets

**Sentry Configuration (for Error Monitoring):**
Add these to your production environment and GitHub Actions secrets:
```
# Get this from your Sentry project settings
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=<your_sentry_dsn>

# For source map uploads during build
SENTRY_ORG=<your_sentry_organization_slug>
SENTRY_PROJECT=<your_sentry_project_slug>
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=<your_sentry_auth_token>
```

### 🗄️ 4. DATABASE SECURITY AUDIT

**Remaining RLS Issues:**
The linter found tables without RLS policies. Non-critical tables but should be reviewed:

```sql
-- Fix remaining tables if they contain sensitive data:
spatial_ref_sys -- (PostGIS system table - likely OK)
valeion_* tables -- (Custom tables - need review)
-- JULES-NOTE: I was unable to find the schema definitions for the `valeion_*` tables
-- in the database migrations. Without the schema, I cannot create the correct RLS policies.
-- This is a potential security risk that needs to be addressed if these tables
-- contain sensitive data. The tables may have been created manually.
```

**Storage Bucket Review:**
Current public buckets (verify these should be public):
- ✅ `frequency-assets` (public: true)
- ✅ `registry-images` (public: true) 
- ✅ `sacred-assets` (public: true)
- ✅ `Sacred Spectrum Files` (public: true)
- ✅ `soundscapes` (public: true)
- 🔒 `fractal-visuals` (private: false) ← Good

### 🚀 5. RELEASE PREPARATION

**Create Release Branch:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0-rc1
git tag v1.0.0-rc1
git push origin release/v1.0.0-rc1
git push origin v1.0.0-rc1
```

**GitHub Release:**
1. Go to GitHub → Releases → Create a new release
2. Tag: `v1.0.0-rc1`
3. Title: "Sacred Shifter v1.0.0-rc1 - Production Release Candidate"
4. Description: Copy from CHANGELOG.md
5. Mark as "Pre-release" until fully tested
