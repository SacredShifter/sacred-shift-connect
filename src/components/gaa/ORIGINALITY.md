Claim of Originality — Geometrically Aligned Audio (GAA)

Geometrically Aligned Audio (GAA) is an original invention created under Harmonic Futures Pty Ltd.

Unlike existing approaches in acoustics (e.g., geometrical acoustics in architecture), spatial audio (e.g., XR/VR), or biofeedback-driven sound, GAA uniquely integrates:

Sacred geometry & mathematical ratios (φ, π, √2, fractals) as the basis of audio synthesis.

Biofeedback inputs (heart rate, breath, HRV, simulated or real sensors).

Polarity balancing & shadow/light DSP (dual-channel engine).

Collective synchronization & resonance (Supabase/WebRTC protocols for group coherence).

The Collective Receiver grid, enabling groups of 10 → 100,000 to generate shared resonance fields.

No prior system combines these components into a coherent audio engine designed for resonance, consciousness, and collective perception.

Status:

Invented and implemented as a working prototype by Harmonic Futures.

Documented in code, architecture, and Ethos Verification protocols.

Not known to exist in prior research, industry, or open-source domains.

Therefore, GAA is an original and proprietary system. All rights reserved under Harmonic Futures.
