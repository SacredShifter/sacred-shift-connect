**Key Features:**
- Live consciousness visualization with chakra alignment
- Real-time sacred timing and lunar phase tracking
- Interactive biofeedback simulation
- Dynamic testimonials rotation
- Responsive design for all devices

### 2. `SacredTechShowcase.tsx`
**Interactive Technology Demonstration**

- **5 Core Demos**: Consciousness, Audio, Collective, Sacred, Biofeedback
- **Real-time Data**: Live updating metrics and visualizations
- **Interactive Controls**: Play/pause, reset, and demo switching
- **Visual Demonstrations**: Sacred geometry animations, chakra visualizations, audio waveforms
- **Production Metrics**: Shows actual production readiness scores and capabilities

**Demo Categories:**
- **Consciousness Engine**: Multi-dimensional assessment with chakra alignment
- **Geometrically Aligned Audio**: 32-oscillator sacred geometry synthesizer
- **Collective Consciousness**: Multi-user synchronization and presence tracking
- **Sacred Journey System**: Cosmic timing, lunar phases, and initiation ceremonies
- **Advanced Biofeedback**: Camera-based heart rate and breathing detection

### 3. `AdNavigation.tsx`
**Simple Navigation for Advertisement Experience**

- **Responsive**: Works across all device sizes

## How It Works

### Real-time Data Simulation
The module simulates real-time data updates to demonstrate the app's capabilities:

```typescript
// Live metrics that update every 2 seconds
const [metrics, setMetrics] = useState({
  activeUsers: 127,
  consciousnessLevel: 4.2,
  resonanceScore: 0.73,
  energyFrequency: 432,
  chakraAlignment: [0.8, 0.6, 0.9, 0.7, 0.8, 0.6, 0.9],
  archetypeResonance: 'The Seeker',
  sacredTiming: 'Dawn Meditation',
  lunarPhase: 'Waxing Crescent'
});
```

### Interactive Demonstrations
Each demo category shows actual functionality:

- **Consciousness Demo**: Real-time chakra alignment bars, consciousness level tracking
- **Audio Demo**: Sacred frequency display, oscillator count, safety status
- **Collective Demo**: Active participant count, coherence level visualization
- **Sacred Demo**: Sacred timing, lunar phase, archetype resonance
- **Biofeedback Demo**: Heart rate simulation, breathing pattern analysis

### Sacred Geometry Animations
Background elements that respond to user interaction:

```typescript
// Rotating sacred geometry elements
<motion.div
  animate={{ rotate: 360 }}
  transition={{ duration: 60, repeat: Infinity, ease: "linear" }}
  className="absolute top-1/4 left-1/4 w-64 h-64 border border-purple-500/20 rounded-full"
/>
```

## Usage
