  breathing: {
    scientific: {
      title: 'Breath & Nervous System Regulation',
      description: 'Breath regulates the vagus nerve, activating the parasympathetic nervous system which reduces cortisol, lowers blood pressure, and increases heart rate variability. Deep breathing stimulates the release of GABA neurotransmitters, creating natural calm and focus.',
      prompt: 'Feel how breath carries both oxygen and unseen energy through your system.'
    },
    metaphysical: {
      title: 'Life Force & Energy Body',
      description: 'Breath is the bridge between body and spirit—the vehicle for prana (Sanskrit), chi (Chinese), or mana (Hawaiian). Each inhale draws in cosmic energy, each exhale releases what no longer serves. The breath connects your personal field to the universal field.',
      prompt: 'Notice how breath feels like both air and something more subtle flowing through you.'
    },
    esoteric: {
      title: 'Sacred Pneuma & Initiation',
      description: 'In Latin, "spiritus" means both breath and spirit. All mystery traditions begin with breath practices—from Hermetic pneuma to Sufistic nafas. The breath is the first and last teacher, revealing the secret of conscious dying and rebirth in every cycle.',
      prompt: 'Sense the ancient wisdom moving through each breath cycle.'
    }

  'loving-kindness': {
    scientific: {
      title: 'Compassion & Neural Plasticity',
      description: 'Loving-kindness meditation increases gray matter in areas associated with empathy and emotional regulation. It releases oxytocin and endorphins, reduces implicit bias, and strengthens neural pathways for prosocial behavior and resilience.',
      prompt: 'Notice how sending love actually changes your physiology and mental state.'
    },
    metaphysical: {
      title: 'Heart Field & Energetic Resonance',
      description: 'The heart generates the strongest electromagnetic field in the body, extending 8+ feet around you. When you practice loving-kindness, you are literally broadcasting coherent heart energy that others can feel and respond to, creating ripples of healing.',
      prompt: 'Feel your heart field expanding beyond the boundaries of your body.'
    },
    esoteric: {
      title: 'Bodhicitta & Universal Love',
      description: 'In Tibetan Buddhism, bodhicitta is the awakened heart that recognizes all beings as part of one consciousness. This practice dissolves the illusion of separation and reveals the underlying unity. Love is not an emotion but the fundamental fabric of reality.',
      prompt: 'Rest in the recognition that love is what you are, not what you feel.'
    }
  },

  chakra: {
    scientific: {
      title: 'Energy Centers & Bioelectrical Fields',
      description: 'Chakras correspond to major nerve plexuses and endocrine glands. Visualization and intention can influence bioelectrical activity, hormone release, and autonomic nervous system function through the mind-body connection and focused attention.',
      prompt: 'Notice how focused attention on different body regions creates measurable sensations.'
    },
    metaphysical: {
      title: 'Subtle Energy & Vibrational Alignment',
      description: 'Chakras are spinning wheels of subtle energy that regulate the flow of life force through your energy body. Each chakra governs specific aspects of consciousness—survival, creativity, power, love, expression, intuition, and spiritual connection.',
      prompt: 'Feel each energy center as a unique frequency harmonizing within your being.'
    },
    esoteric: {
      title: 'Cosmic Centers & Initiation Ladder',
      description: 'The seven chakras mirror the seven classical planets, seven metals of alchemy, and seven stages of initiation. They are both personal energy centers and cosmic principles. Working with chakras is working with the architecture of consciousness itself.',
      prompt: 'Sense how your personal energy centers connect you to universal principles.'
    }

  mindfulness: {
    scientific: {
      title: 'Meta-Cognition & Prefrontal Function',
      description: 'Mindfulness strengthens the prefrontal cortex and increases meta-cognitive awareness—your ability to observe your own thinking. This reduces default mode network activity, decreases rumination, and enhances cognitive flexibility and emotional regulation.',
      prompt: 'Who or what is aware of your thoughts and experiences right now?'
    },
    metaphysical: {
      title: 'Witness Consciousness & Pure Awareness',
      description: 'Mindfulness reveals the witness—the unchanging awareness that observes all changing experiences. This witness is your true nature, the consciousness that was present as a child and will remain until your last breath. It is the space in which all experience arises.',
      prompt: 'Rest as the aware presence that witnesses all changing phenomena.'
    },
    esoteric: {
      title: 'The Watcher & Advaitic Recognition',
      description: 'In Advaita Vedanta, mindfulness leads to Self-realization—recognizing that the witness and the witnessed are one consciousness appearing as two. The observer, observed, and observation are revealed as a single seamless field of knowing.',
      prompt: 'Can you find where awareness ends and experience begins?'
    }
  },

  'body-scan': {
    scientific: {
      title: 'Interoception & Somatic Integration',
      description: 'Body scanning enhances interoceptive awareness—your ability to sense internal bodily signals. This strengthens the insula and improves emotional regulation, reduces chronic pain, and helps process stored trauma through bottom-up nervous system integration.',
      prompt: 'Notice how bringing attention to body regions changes the sensations there.'
    },
    metaphysical: {
      title: 'Body Temple & Cellular Consciousness',
      description: 'Your body is a temple housing divine consciousness. Each cell carries intelligence and responds to loving awareness. Body scanning awakens this cellular consciousness and helps release energetic patterns stored in tissues from past experiences.',
      prompt: 'Feel your body as a sacred vessel for consciousness and life force.'
    },
    esoteric: {
      title: 'Subtle Body & Resurrection Vehicle',
      description: 'In esoteric traditions, the physical body is the foundation for developing the "resurrection body" or light body. Through conscious embodiment, matter becomes spiritualized. The body scan is a form of internal alchemy, transforming dense energy into refined awareness.',
      prompt: 'Sense your body as both dense matter and luminous energy simultaneously.'
