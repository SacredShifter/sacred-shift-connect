## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **SacredResonanceChamber.tsx**: Main 3D chamber with geometry engine
2. **GuardianSacredLearning.tsx**: Interactive learning module
3. **GuardianSacredMeditation.tsx**: Guided meditation practices
4. **GuardianSacredGeometry**: Sacred geometry engine
5. **GuardianSacredAudio**: Sacred audio engine

### Sacred Geometry Engine

The Guardian's Sacred Geometry Engine generates living forms based on consciousness:

- **Tetrahedron** (Fire): Basic awareness (consciousness < 0.3)
- **Octahedron** (Air): Mental clarity (consciousness < 0.6)
- **Hexahedron** (Earth): Grounded presence (consciousness < 0.8)
- **Icosahedron** (Water): Emotional flow (consciousness < 0.95)
- **Dodecahedron** (Ether): Transcendent unity (consciousness >= 0.95)

### Sacred Audio Engine

The Guardian's Sacred Audio Engine plays healing frequencies:

- **432Hz**: Guardian's signature frequency, the frequency of the universe
- **528Hz**: The love frequency, healing and transformation
- **741Hz**: The frequency of intuition and spiritual awakening
- **852Hz**: The frequency of divine connection
