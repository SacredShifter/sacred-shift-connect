## Part 1: Hermetic Principles

This section covers the seven interactive scenes that teach the Hermetic Principles.

### 1. Principle of Mentalism (`Mentalism.tsx`)
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Critical Performance Optimization**: The particle animation logic **must** be moved from the CPU to the GPU by implementing it in a custom shader.
    2.  **Integrate "Thought" Input**: Connect the text input to the visualization.
    3.  **Visual Polish**: Add glow or size attenuation to the particles.
    4.  **Content Enhancement**: Add an expandable "Learn More" panel to the UI. This panel should contain a more detailed explanation of the principle, a quote from The Kybalion, practical examples of its application, and a reflective question.

### 2. Principle of Correspondence (`Correspondence.tsx`)
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Implement Toggle Buttons**: The "Toggle Phi" and "Toggle Branching Angle" buttons should be made functional.
    2.  **Enhance Visuals**: Replace the simple spheres with more detailed 3D models.
    3.  **Content Enhancement**: Add an expandable "Learn More" panel with a detailed explanation, a quote, practical examples, and a reflective question.

### 3. Principle of Vibration (`Vibration.tsx`)
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Critical Performance Optimization**: The particle animation logic **must** be moved to a GPU shader.
    2.  **Visualize Frequency**: The "frequency" slider should affect the visuals, not just the audio.
    3.  **Optimize Audio Context**: The `AudioContext` should be created only once.
    4.  **Content Enhancement**: Add an expandable "Learn More" panel with a detailed explanation, a quote, practical examples, and a reflective question.

### 4. Principle of Polarity (`Polarity.tsx`)
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Implement Smooth Transitions**: Replace the abrupt switch between geometries with a smooth transition using shaders or morph targets.
    2.  **Synchronize Visuals with Labels**: Ensure the 3D visuals match the three UI labels (Ice, Water, Vapor).
    3.  **Content Enhancement**: Add an expandable "Learn More" panel with a detailed explanation, a quote, practical examples, and a reflective question.

### 5. Principle of Rhythm (`Rhythm.tsx`)
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Add User Interaction**: Allow users to "push" the pendulum.
    2.  **Visualize Compensation**: Add UI elements to show the equality of the swing.
    3.  **Content Enhancement**: Add an expandable "Learn More" panel with a detailed explanation, a quote, practical examples, and a reflective question.

### 6. Principle of Cause & Effect (`CauseEffect.tsx`)
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Visual Feedback**: Enhance the node activation with more dynamic visual effects.
    2.  **Complex Scenarios**: Add buttons to load different, more complex graphs.
    3.  **Content Enhancement**: Add an expandable "Learn More" panel with a detailed explanation, a quote, practical examples, and a reflective question.

### 7. Principle of Gender (`Gender.tsx`)
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Dynamic "Creation" Object**: The "Creation" object should change in complexity, not just scale.
    2.  **Contextual Explanations**: Add dynamic text that explains what is happening.
    3.  **Content Enhancement**: Add an expandable "Learn More" panel with a detailed explanation, a quote, practical examples, and a reflective question.

## Part 2: 3D Learning Modules

This section covers the more complex, multi-faceted 3D learning applications.

### 1. Breath of Source 3D (`BreathOfSource3D.tsx`)
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Unify State Management**: Consolidate the component's state into a single source of truth.
    2.  **Fix Background Animation**: The `uTime` uniform in the background shader should be updated.
    3.  **Content Enhancement**: The `LessonContent` component is a good start, but it could be enhanced with more detailed scientific and metaphysical explanations for each stage of the breathing exercise. Add diagrams or short video clips to illustrate concepts like "heart coherence" or "vagal toning".

### 2. Chakra Learning 3D (`ChakraLearning3D.tsx`)
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Animate the Energy Flow**: The `EnergyFlow` particles should be animated.
    2.  **Add Audio Feedback**: Play the associated frequency when a chakra is selected.
    3.  **Externalize Chakra Data**: Move the `chakraData` to a separate file.
    4.  **Content Enhancement**: Add a "Meditation Focus" section to the info panel. This section would provide a short, guided meditation text or audio cue to help the user connect with the selected energy center.

### 3. Energy Literacy 3D (`EnergyLiteracy3D.tsx`)
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Animate 3D Interactions**: Animate the "drain" and "restoration" events.
    2.  **Incorporate Sound Design**: Add sound effects for key events.
    3.  **Content Enhancement**: Add a "Learn Why" button next to each drain and restoration method. Clicking it would open a modal explaining *why* something is a drain (e.g., the neurological effects of social media) or *how* a restoration method works (e.g., the physiological benefits of deep breathing).

### 4. Kabbalah Tree of Life 3D (`KabbalahTreeOfLife3D.tsx`)
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Path Interaction**: When a Sephirah is selected, highlight the paths connected to it. When a path is hovered or clicked, show a tooltip with the corresponding Hebrew letter, its tarot correspondence, and its meaning. This would add a significant layer of depth and interactivity to the model.
    2.  **Pillar Highlighting**: Allow the user to click on the "Pillar of Mercy," "Pillar of Severity," or "Middle Pillar" in the UI to highlight all the Sephiroth belonging to that pillar in the 3D view.
    3.  **Detailed Descriptions**: The current descriptions are brief. Expand them to include more information about the planetary correspondence, the angelic order, and the virtues associated with each Sephirah.
