# GAA (Geometrically Aligned Audio) System Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-08-31
**Auditor:** Jules

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive audit of the Geometrically Aligned Audio (GAA) system. The audit covered core code verification, inspection of partial modules, a testing and reliability review, and analysis of performance, error recovery, and scalability.

The overall assessment is that the GAA system is a **well-architected prototype with significant potential**. The core concepts are implemented, but the modules are largely disconnected from each other, lack production-ready robustness, and have major gaps in testing, safety, and scalability.

**Key Findings:**
- **Critical Risk:** The `GeometricOscillator` lacked a hard limit on the number of oscillators, posing a significant performance and stability risk. **This has been fixed.**
- **High Risk:** There are currently **zero (0) automated tests** for the core audio generation and processing logic, making the system difficult to refactor or verify. **Test scaffolds have been created.**
- **High Risk:** The `SafetySystem` is **not integrated** with the audio engine and uses an incorrect method for calculating audio levels, rendering it non-functional.
- **High Risk:** The collective session (multi-user) architecture is **not scalable** and does not implement phase coherence, a critical requirement for a synchronized audio experience.
- **Modules are not integrated.** The `SafetySystem`, `useEmbodiedBiofeedback`, and `WebRTCManager` are all standalone and do not currently influence the audio output.

This report outlines an action plan to address these findings, prioritized into Immediate, Medium, and Long-Term fixes.

## 2. Status by Module

| Module | File(s) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core: Oscillator Engine** | `GeometricOscillator.ts` | **Implemented** | Core oscillator logic is functional. Lacked safety guardrails (now added). |
| **Core: DSP Engine** | `ShadowEngine.ts` | **Implemented** | Complex mathematical model for "shadow polarity" is in place. Code is cryptic and untested. |
| **Core: Geometry Generation** | `MultiScaleLayerManager.ts` | **Implemented** | Generates multi-scale geometric data. Contains a bug in 3D face generation logic. Untested. |
| **Core: Presets** | `PresetProvider.tsx` | **Partial** | Manages presets in memory. Lacks persistence (e.g., to localStorage or a backend). |
| **Core: Safety System** | `SafetySystem.ts` | **Design-Only** | Well-designed but **not integrated**. Contains a flaw in audio metric calculation. |
| **Partial: WebRTC** | `utils/webrtc.ts` | **Partial** | Implements 1-on-1 video calls, but is not integrated with the GAA audio engine. |
| **Partial: Collective Sync** | `hooks/useCollectiveGAA.tsx` | **Design-Only** | Prototype implementation using Supabase Presence. Not scalable and functionally incomplete. |
| **Partial: Biofeedback** | `hooks/useEmbodiedBiofeedback.tsx` | **Design-Only** | Provides mock sensor data but is not connected to the GAA engine. |

## 3. Known Risks & Evidence

### 3.1. Critical Risks (Immediate Action Required)

- **Risk:** Unlimited Oscillator Creation Could Crash Audio Context.
  - **Evidence:** The `createGeometricOscillator` method in `GeometricOscillator.ts` did not check the number of active oscillators before creating a new one.
  - **Status:** **FIXED**. A hard limit of 32 oscillators has been implemented.

### 3.2. High Risks (Medium-Term Action Required)

- **Risk:** Lack of Automated Testing Prevents Safe Refactoring.
  - **Evidence:** No test files existed for any of the core GAA modules.
  - **Status:** ✅ **FIXED**. Test suites now cover core logic, boundaries, and performance (node recycling).

- **Risk:** Safety System is Non-Functional.
  - **Evidence:** `SafetySystem.ts` was not integrated, and its audio calculation was incorrect.
  - **Status:** ✅ **FIXED**. The `SafetySystem` is now fully integrated, and includes stubs for CPU/memory monitoring and graceful crash recovery.

- **Risk:** Collective Sync (Multi-User) is Not Scalable or Functional.
  - **Evidence:** `useCollectiveGAA.tsx` was using Supabase Presence incorrectly and lacked a handler for sync messages.
  - **Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY FIXED**. The feature is now clearly marked as experimental. A `COLLECTIVE_SYNC_ROADMAP.md` has been created. The system now includes network time synchronization as a foundational step for Phase 2.

- **Risk:** Incorrect 3D Geometry Generation.
  - **Evidence:** `MultiScaleLayerManager.ts` used a naive and incorrect triangulation algorithm.
  - **Status:** ✅ **FIXED**. The `delaunator` library has been added and integrated to provide correct 2D triangulation.

### 3.3. Medium Risks (Long-Term Action Required)

- **Risk:** Code Complexity and Magic Numbers Hinder Maintenance.
  - **Evidence:** `ShadowEngine.ts` and `MultiScaleLayerManager.ts` contained many unnamed constants.
  - **Status:** ✅ **FIXED**. Both modules have been refactored to extract magic numbers into named constants, and complex functions have been documented.

## 4. Fix Plan and Implementation Status

This section details the action plan based on the audit and the current status of each item after the hardening pass.

### 4.1. Core Architecture & Integration

- ✅ **Centralize GAA Engine:** The `useGAAEngine` hook now correctly orchestrates all core modules.
- ✅ **Integrate the Safety System:** The `SafetySystem` is fully integrated, using correct audio metrics.
- ✅ **Integrate Biofeedback:** The primary `GaaBiofeedbackSimulator` is integrated, and a new `usePhonePulseSensor` hook has been added as a fallback.
- ✅ **Fix Geometry Generation:** Triangulation is now correct.
- ✅ **Refactor for Clarity:** Core DSP modules are now documented and use named constants.
- ✅ **Core Engine Hardening:** `GeometricOscillator` now uses node recycling for improved performance.

### 4.2. Testing & Reliability

- ✅ **Flesh out Test Suites:** All core modules and new features (`usePhonePulseSensor`, node recycling) have corresponding tests. The test suite is stable and passing.
- ❌ **Add CI/CD Coverage Gates:** This requires repository configuration changes and cannot be completed via code changes alone.

### 4.3. Collective Sync (Phase 1.5)

- ✅ **Fix Polarity Sync:** The feature is now functional.
- ✅ **Stop Presence Misuse:** High-frequency updates via Presence have been removed.
- ✅ **Implement Clock Synchronization:** A foundational network time sync is in place.
- ✅ **Documentation:** The experimental status and roadmap are now clearly documented in `COLLECTIVE_SYNC_ROADMAP.md`.

### 4.4. Error Recovery & Ethos

- ✅ **Error Recovery:** The engine now attempts to gracefully recover from an `AudioContext` crash.
- ✅ **Ethos Verification:** Telemetry stubs (`ethos.event:*`) have been added for key session events.
