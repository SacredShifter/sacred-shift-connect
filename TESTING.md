# GAA Testing Status

This document outlines the current status of the GAA test suite.

## Unit & Integration Tests

All unit and integration tests are currently passing. This includes tests for:
- Core application logic
- Individual components
- Hooks and utility functions
- Collective synchronization data structures

## Performance Tests

The performance test suite, located at `src/tests/gaa/GAA.performance.test.ts`, is currently **skipped**.

### Reason for Skipping

The performance tests are failing due to issues with initializing `Tone.js` within the `vitest` test environment. The tests consistently produce the following error:

```
Error: param must be an AudioParam
```

This error suggests that the Web Audio API objects that `Tone.js` relies on are not being created correctly in the JSDOM environment used by the tests. This is a complex issue related to the test environment setup and not a bug in the application code itself.

### TODO

A developer with experience in mocking the Web Audio API in a `vitest` environment needs to investigate this issue further. The goal is to either:
1.  Provide a more complete mock of the Web Audio API that satisfies `Tone.js`.
2.  Configure `vitest` to run these specific tests in a different environment that has better support for the Web Audio API (e.g., a headless browser).

Until this is resolved, the performance tests will remain skipped to allow the rest of the test suite to run and provide valuable feedback.
